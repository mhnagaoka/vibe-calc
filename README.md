## ✨ Features

### Currently Implemented

- ✅ **Number Input**: Full numeric input with decimal point support
- ✅ **RPN Stack Display**: Shows all 4 stack registers (T, Z, Y, X)
- ✅ **Enter Operation**: Pushes values onto the stack with proper stack lifting
- ✅ **Math Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division with proper RPN semantics
- ✅ **Stack Operations**: Swap, drop, clear stack, last X recall
- ✅ **Backspace**: Remove digits from current input with proper X register handling
- ✅ **Core RPN Engine**: Pure TypeScript implementation with comprehensive tests
- ✅ **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN components

## 🧮 What is RPN?

**Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)** is a mathematical notation where operators follow their operands. Instead of typing `3 + 4 =`, you enter:

1. **Type 3** → X register shows 3
2. **Press Enter** → Stack lifts, Y gets 3, X stays 3
3. **Type 4** → X becomes 4, Y remains 3
4. **Press +** → Calculates 3 + 4 = 7

### Stack Registers

- **X**: Current/top value (most recent)
- **Y**: Second value
- **Z**: Third value
- **T**: Fourth value

## 🎯 Why Choose RPN?

RPN calculators offer several advantages over traditional infix calculators:

### 1. **No Parentheses Needed**

RPN eliminates the need for parentheses in complex calculations:

- **Regular**: `(3 + 4) × (5 + 6) =`
- **RPN**: `3 4 + 5 6 + ×`

### 2. **Natural Problem-Solving Flow**

RPN follows how you naturally solve math problems step by step:

- Calculate intermediate results as you go
- Each step builds on the previous result
- No need to remember operator precedence rules

### 3. **More Efficient Entry**

For chain calculations, RPN requires fewer keystrokes:

- **Regular**: `15 + 25 = 40, then 40 × 3 = 120`
- **RPN**: `15 25 + 3 ×` (no equals button needed)

### 4. **Complete Visibility**

The 4-register stack (T, Z, Y, X) gives you:

- Full visibility of your calculation state
- Easy reuse of previous results
- Better understanding of intermediate values

### 5. **Fewer Calculation Errors**

RPN reduces mistakes because:

- No ambiguity about order of operations
- Immediate feedback on intermediate results
- Stack operations (swap, drop, last X) help correct errors quickly

### 6. **Professional Heritage**

RPN is the preferred choice of:

- Engineers and scientists
- Financial professionals
- Anyone doing complex calculations regularly
- Users of classic HP calculators

### 7. **Consistent Logic**

Every RPN operation follows the same simple pattern:

1. Enter operands onto the stack
2. Press the operator
3. Result appears immediately

The trade-off is an initial learning curve, but users who master RPN often find it much more efficient and intuitive for their calculation workflows!

### Key Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Pure calculator logic separate from UI
- **Immutable State**: All operations return new state objects
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for all calculator operations
- **Component-Based**: Modular React components

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing at multiple levels:

### Unit Tests
- Core RPN calculator operations (enter, setX, stack lifting)
- Stack management operations (swap, drop, clear, last X)
- Math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Input handling (backspace, number entry, decimal points)
- Error handling (division by zero, invalid operations)
- Real-world calculation workflows

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete calculator workflows with Playwright
- UI interaction testing (button clicks, display updates)
- Cross-browser compatibility (Desktop Chrome, Mobile Chrome)
- Error scenario testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:run

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
