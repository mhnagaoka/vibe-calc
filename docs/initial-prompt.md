My intent with this project is the following:

- develop a project using "vibe coding", i.e. interacting with a LLM and develop a project from scratch avoiding coding as much as possible;
- learn some front end development.

To achieve this, I want to implement a RPN Calculator. I would like it to perform some basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. Being a RPN calculator, it will also need some basic stack operations like push (enter), swap, drop, clear, last x, backspace and clear x.

I would like it to be web based, using frontend libraries like React, Tailwind CSS and ShadCN components. I would not like it to have a backend for now.

Please do not generate any code yet. I would just like you to outline a plan so we can work this out together, step-by-step so I can understand your thinking process and the technical details of the project. Please make this plan a markdown file with checkbox for each step so we can keep track of the progress we make.

I understand that a good approach to organize the project code is to keep the UI logic and the core RPN calculator logic apart. However, I would not like the plan to implement the whole thing in a single step. I would like it to have every operation (math and stack) implemented in a separate step.
